Let's talk about
## data placement


### Conventional
lookup in
### distributed
storage systems


Talk to a
### central lookup service
then talk to
### storage servers


Conventional placement with central lookup:
## scalability?
## Nope. <!-- .element class="fragment stamp" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/ceph-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Don't look it up, <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
## work it out. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


Now, how do
## Placement Groups
come in?
